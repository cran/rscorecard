# rscorecard 0.6.0

### Changes
* allow `sc_zip()` to take zip codes that start with zero (h/t
  @nateaff), either with string value or by returning leading zeros to
  numeric values that R drops

# rscorecard 0.5.0

### Changes
* Changed way API call is made (now using [`httr`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=httr) to make call rather than `jsonlite` directly) in order to improve parsing on bad lines
* added `debug` option to `sc_get()` so that the API URL string could be returned when debugging call
* removed old namespace import/exports no longer being used

# rscorecard 0.4.0

* update dictionary for 28 September 2017 release of scorecard data

* change contact information
* read data dictionary sheet by name instead of sheet number when
  making `sysdata.rda` in `./data-raw/make_dict_hash.R`
* correct `sc_get()` to use `floor()` instead of `ceiling()` so that
  it doesn't make unnecessary API request/pull (h/t @jjchern)
